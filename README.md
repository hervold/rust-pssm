# rust-pssm: a port of the Biopython's motif module

Position-specific scoring matrices (also known as position weight matrices (PWM) or position-specific weight matrices (PSWM)) capture patterns from biological sequences as a series of weights.  For more information, see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_weight_matrix) or the [documention](http://biopython-cn.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/en/chr14.html) for Biopython's [motifs module](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/tree/master/Bio/motifs).

## TODO
- add file parsers
- add support for amino acid motifs
- support Rust-Bio's [alphabets](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio/tree/master/src/alphabets)
